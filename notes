Slide 1: Title Slide
What to Show:
- Title: Review Prioritisation Model for Customers Exceeding Cash Deposit Thresholds
- Subtitle: Optimising AML Detection Through AI & Data Science
- Your name, role (Principal Analyst, Financial Crime & Compliance Analytics)
- Company logo (if applicable)
- A clean & professional design with the bank’s branding.
What to Say:
- Welcome everyone and introduce yourself.
- Briefly mention the importance of using AI-driven methods to enhance financial crime detection.
- Set the tone: "Today's session will focus on how AI can improve prioritisation, reduce resource strain, and boost AML detection efficiency."
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Start with a problem statement: "Banks are under pressure to enhance financial crime controls while managing operational efficiency. How can AI help?"
- Use an engaging opening statistic (e.g., "Money laundering accounts for 2-5% of global GDP—over $2 trillion annually.").

Slide 2: Introduction & Context
What to Show:
- Summary of AML regulations and risk mitigation.
- Visual: A flowchart illustrating the legacy customer review process.
- Data Point: Current UAR rate (6.4%) vs. target improvement (10%).
What to Say:
- Explain why banks monitor cash deposits.
- Describe the existing manual review process and its inefficiencies.
- Introduce the AML compliance risks and FCA regulatory pressure.
Technical Notes:
- AML regulations mandate systematic cash review controls to prevent illicit financial activity.
- Legacy manual processes rely on static spreadsheets, rule-based suppression, and periodic rescinding—this is slow and labour-intensive.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Include a real-world example: "Recent FCA sanctions highlight banks failing AML compliance due to inadequate review processes."

Slide 3: Business Problem & Key Challenge
What to Show:
- Visual: Comparison between the legacy vs. AI-driven approach (flow diagram).
- Breakdown of resource demand before and after optimisation.
What to Say:
- Outline the two key challenges:
- Optimising UAR detection rate (moving from 6.4% to 10%).
- Reducing caseload volume without sacrificing detection quality.
Technical Notes:
- The challenge is optimising precision vs recall in fraud detection.
- Balancing false positives (wasting resources) vs false negatives (missing actual money laundering).
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Reinforce stakeholder pain points: "The manual process consumes over 2,272 hours annually, creating bottlenecks."

Slide 4: Research Approach & Methodology
What to Show:
- Visual: Table outlining selected ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM).
- Summary of GCP Dataproc pipeline and Looker Core visualisation output.
What to Say:
- Explain the chosen AI models and why tree-based models were preferred.
- Introduce data architecture on GCP & the use of automated pipelines.
Technical Notes:
- Decision Tree as a baseline → Random Forest & LightGBM as advanced ensemble models.
- Use of stratified train-test split, cross-validation, and grid search hyperparameter tuning.
- Explainability techniques (SHAP values, feature importance) ensure stakeholder confidence.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Highlight that the Random Forest model significantly outperformed Decision Trees.
- Use a quote from regulators or AML experts to reinforce why AI models are crucial in compliance.

Slide 5: Data Selection & Feature Engineering
What to Show:
- Diagram: Data pipeline showing structured (static details) vs unstructured (transactional patterns).
- Heatmap: Correlation matrix of key features.
What to Say:
- Describe how dynamic features helped mimic reviewer decisions.
- Discuss bias mitigation techniques in feature selection.
Technical Notes:
- Removing protected characteristics (GDPR compliance).
- Use of aggregated behaviour metrics to define abnormal cash movement.
- Handling null values using encoding rather than imputation.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Show feature importance rankings (SHAP values) to illustrate transparency in AI decisions.

Slide 6: Model Development & Performance Evaluation
What to Show:
- Visual: Confusion matrix comparison (Decision Tree vs. Random Forest).
- Feature Importance chart (SHAP values).
What to Say:
- How Random Forest outperformed other models in recall & precision.
- Why optimising the F2-score ensures false negatives are minimised.
Technical Notes:
- Hyperparameter tuning included adjusting estimators, depth constraints, and class balancing.
- Explainability considerations ensure compliance with EU AI Act & internal governance.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Use before-and-after metrics to show improvements ("We reduced workload by 87% while improving AML detection.").

Slide 7: Stakeholder Engagement & Business Implementation
What to Show:
- Stakeholder feedback timeline (iterative improvements).
- Screenshot of Looker Core dashboard UI.
What to Say:
- Explain how reviewers influenced feature selection.
- Discuss balancing technical vs non-technical stakeholder needs.
Technical Notes:
- Interpretable AI models improve confidence in recommendations.
- Automated dashboard with write-back functionality replaces spreadsheets.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Show an example reviewer scenario where the model correctly flagged high-risk behaviour.

Slide 8: Business Recommendations & Next Steps
What to Show:
- Projected savings chart: 1,500+ resource hours saved annually.
- Roadmap: Model retraining, ongoing audits.
What to Say:
- Mitigation strategies for future drift (bi-annual retraining).
- How the model aligns with business goals (efficiency + compliance).
Technical Notes:
- SHAP-based explainability assessments ensure model interpretability over time.
- Periodically retraining models mitigates concept drift.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- End with a strong impact statement ("Optimising AML detection saves resources while improving risk mitigation.").

Slide 9: Conclusion & Q&A
What to Show:
- Final takeaways (summary bullets).
- Call to action: Open floor for questions.
What to Say:
- Recap business impact, model success, and future integration.
- Invite stakeholder discussion on next iterations & risk priorities.
How to Make it More Compelling:
- Use a powerful closing statement: "This AI-driven approach is not just about efficiency—it strengthens our AML controls and safeguards financial integrity."

Missing Elements & Final Enhancements
What to add:
- Comparison slide with potential alternative solutions (manual rules, non-ML heuristic models).
- Governance slide explaining regulatory alignment (GDPR, EU AI Act, FCA AML Compliance).
