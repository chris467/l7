The same process can be applied to cycling and walking trips. However, this approach distorts the data and amplifies any noise present in those particular samples, thereby increasing the Signal to Noise Ratio.

In situations where the tool's classifications carry high-cost implications, such as classifying medical conditions, it is beneficial to have human expertise involved, such as a doctor, who can make the final decision. In such cases, having a probability distribution as an output can complement the decision-making process. This approach may prompt further tests, data collection, or enable the formulation of a diagnosis and treatment plan.\n","\n","On the other hand, for low-cost decisions like determining which advertisement to play next on a video streaming service, a deterministic classifier might be more suitable.\n","\n","However, the probabilistic classifier, being a more sophisticated tool, still offers deployment possibilities. For instance, if the classifier assesses the likelihood of a web user responding to different advertisements, a sequence of ads can be selected based on their descending likelihood. Additionally, tools can be incorporated to update probabilities based on user responses to the ads encountered so far or make use of assumptions about the real world to enhance predictions. For instance, if a user displays an interest in sandwiches, advertising just before lunchtime may be the most opportune moment.\n","\n","Probabilistic models also lend themselves to simulations, which can be highly valuable. Although they generally do not surpass well-designed deterministic classifiers in terms of accuracy or confusion matrix, these simulations can deliver remarkable outcomes.
